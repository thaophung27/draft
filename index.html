          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them. <br />

          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by
          supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
          (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
          place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
          mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript
          extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
          JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an
          application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of
          information from one invocation to another of the application, or
          perform file manipulations on a server
            </li>
          </ul>
